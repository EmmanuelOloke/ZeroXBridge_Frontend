# ⚡ ZeroXBridge Frontend

> Decentralized cross-chain liquidity without bridging — powered by ZK on Starknet.

ZeroXBridge is a trustless liquidity protocol that allows users to lock assets on Ethereum and instantly access liquidity on Starknet — without moving or wrapping assets. This is the frontend for the ZeroXBridge protocol, currently being redesigned from scratch in the `zero-x-v2` branch.
